# Breakout COVID

Breakout COVID can be used as an app and website, which uses Machine Learning model to suggest business companies whether or not they should close down their business or not. This issue started to appear earlier last month, where companies, including Apple, started to close down their stores due to the Coronavirus outbreak. This caused many other companies to debate whether it is too early to or too late to close their business. We realized that based on the data we have about COVID-19, we can find solution to this by training machine learning model to exactly this. The mobile app, which is developed with flutter, and webapp use this machine learning model to tell its customers whether they its too risky or not to close their business. Along with this prediction, the users are also able to look at a bar chart to see the COVID-19 related data with ease and all in one place.
